This program allows you to split one terminal into many. When you run tmux , you create a tmux session. This session can survive interrupted network connections, so if you lose your internet, you can pick up right where you left off by reattaching to your still-running session. In each session, you can have multiple windows (selectable like tabs in a web browser), and in each window, you can have multiple panes. This lets you have several terminals side-by-side in just one! Isn't that handy? Tmuxp Tmuxp is a session manager for tmux. It's built on top of a Python library for tmux, called libtmux. Tmuxp makes it easy to launch preconfigured tmux sessions with the panes and windows you want already loaded. You can even set it to run commands! With built-in delays too! SSH SSH, or Secure Shell, allows you to connect to computers remotely through your terminal. When you combine tmux with SSH, you end up with a robust way for controlling a remote computer. ZeroTier ZeroTier is a service that allows for creating virtual LAN networks between computers through a technique called UDP holepunching. This allows for computers on different networks that are connected to the internet to behave as if they are on the same networking, saving a lot of headache on port-forwarding and other issues when remoting into devices. Husarnet Husarnet is similar to ZeroTier, but developed specifically with ROS in mind. This is yet to be tested, but it should have the ability to connect devices on the same network even without an internet connection.","title":"Networking"},{"location":"devops/networking/#networking-tools-for-robotics","text":"","title":"Networking Tools for Robotics"},{"location":"devops/networking/#tmux-and-tmuxp","text":"","title":"Tmux and Tmuxp"},{"location":"devops/networking/#tmux","text":"Tmux is a commonly used terminal multiplexer.

Currently, we use ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy (released for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). Installing ROS2 ROS2 is most well-supported on the Ubuntu Linux operating system, and most packages are developed with this OS in mind. While ROS2 is supported on Windows and to a limited extent on MacOS, our robots will be running Ubuntu, so it is best if we keep our development and deployment environments as similar as possible. It is possible to work with Ubuntu on your Windows or Mac machines with x86 processors. ARM processors such as the M-series on Macs may cause complications. In most cases, you will end up with either a virtual or native version of Ubuntu on your system, and will follow the instructions for Ubuntu as the final step. If this proves to be difficult for your system, computers are available in the lab for working with ROS2. ROS2 on Windows Using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) Through Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), Ubuntu can be installed on a Windows machine without the need for dual booting. See the video below for more. Using Virtual Machine (VMs) Virtual machines (VMs) allow for the simulation of other operating systems on your native operating system. The video below covers the installation of ROS1 Melodic through the use of a VM. Note that this is not the current version of Ubuntu or ROS that we are using. Dual Booting With most Windows machines, given enough storage space, it is possible to partition the disk and boot both Windows and Ubuntu natively on the same machine. However, this is also the most involved method of using Ubuntu with a Windows machine, and a backup of your files is highly recommended before attempting this. ROS2 on MacOS Welcome to the road not taken . We have not yet investigated ROS2 on MacOS (Intel or M-series). If you're interested in paving this road, please let someone know! ROS2 on Linux Distributions other than Ubuntu On Linux distributions other than Ubuntu, methods involving Docker or Podman containers will likely provide the highest level of integration with the system. Distrobox may be a useful tool for this scenario. ROS2 on Ubuntu Linux For Ubuntu, the instructions available on the ROS2 documentation should suffice for installation.","title":"Getting Started with ROS2"},{"location":"devops/ros/getting-started/#getting-started-with-ros2","text":"Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is the robotics framework upon which we base our software.
